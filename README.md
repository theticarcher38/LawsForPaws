# LawsForPaws
A mobile application made for my Leadership School Capstone project

## Run the app

To run the program for testing purposes you will need to run the following command in your command line to clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theticarcher38/LawsForPaws.git
```

After that you need to have the Ionic Framework installed. Do so by running the following:

```bash
npm install -g @ionic/cli
```

You will also need to have React.js installed

```bash
npm install react
```

Then in the ionic directory for the project which will differ from person to person but will look something like:

```bash
../../LawsForPaws/LawsForPawsApp
```

Once you are in the ionic project directory run:

```bash
ionic serve
```
